#Predictive Models Challenge

On December 17, 2015, the Tech Tank Data Science Cohort met to kickoff their class. What is Tech Tank?

>The Tech Tank is designed to rapidly build a pool of high-demand data scientists in an innovative and differentiated way. The Program will produce:
* A highly networked and visible cadre of high potential junior data science talent
* Emerging leaders whose functional expertise is complemented with consulting skills
* Professionals who can be deployed against clientsâ€™ most complex problems

This kickoff event included a Predictive Models Challenge. The cohort formed into teams of 4-5 people. Using a predefined challenge and data sets, each team was asked to plot the distributions of each possible outcome to create a predictive model and present results to their colleagues. The challenge had to objectives:
* Demonstrate ability to synthesize disparate data to develop a predictability model
* Demonstrate ability to collaborate successfully in a team to accomplish objectives in a timely manner

Teams were offered two different challenges to choose from. This repo contains the code for some of the solutions developed by the teams. Here is a description of both challanges:

##_Titanic Challenge_
* Create a simple model for predicting the survivability of passengers on the historic Titanic disaster
* Plot the distributions of each of the possible factors that could influence survival/non survival
* Identify thresholds in the distributions to build a model that predicts survival/non survival

##_Random Acts of Pizza_
* Create a simple model for predicting whether or not a person will receive a free pizza based on the text of their pizza request on the raopredditmessage boards
* Plot the distributions of each of the possible factors that could influence the gift of pizza
* Identify thresholds in the distributions to build a model that predicts pizza or no pizza
